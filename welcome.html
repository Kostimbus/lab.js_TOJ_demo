    <p class="filling_text"> In the following computer-based experiment, we investigate the control of spatial
        visual attention and the perception of time. It is of great importance that you report your perceptions
        as accurately as possible or respond as accurate as possible. The exact details and instructions for
        the concrete task are given just before the start of the experiment.</p>
    <p class="filling_text"> Please be aware that these experiments require attention and mental focus and can
        be fatiguing. If this is the case, please take short breaks.</p>
